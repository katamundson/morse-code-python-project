# morse-code-python-project  
This is a morse code translater that I did for a final project for CIS 189:Python. Uses Tkinter that translates between Morse Code and English. User receives a GUI that prompts them to enter what they want to translate and pick either English or Morse Code. The user then receives the translated version of the language they chose.
